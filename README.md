# UNITA SocialWall
UNITA is a SDK for developing applications using ultrasonic communication, as well as a hardware solution for sending and receiving ultrasound signals, called UNITA beacon. It consists of a development kit for implementing applications on the beacon and for client applications. Further, a server setup is included. SocialWall is a proof-of-concept application.

The area of Internet of Things (IoT) gained increasing importance in recent years. More and more everyday devices become smart and connected.  Most of today’s IoT devices communicate via Wireless LAN or Bluetooth, which do not provide a seamless experience. This thesis focuses on the development and construction of an Ultrasonic Network for IoT Applications (UNITA). 

The master thesis was pursued by Florian Taurer at the University of Applied Sciences in St. Pölten.
